# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Design a monster!

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Choose from a variety of options to design your monster

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will prompt you to select a type of a feature then ask if you like it or if you'd like to reselect. 
EX:
Select eye type: wide, angry, multi, glowing, or sad
*eye type pops up*
Do you want to select another?
etc...

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A visual monster that you can customize. The placement might be slighly off depending on certain selections.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Variations in placement for certain features based off of prior decisions.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A smooth design that works with any combination of choices.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps require me drawing out all of the separate images in photoshop. I then need to learn how to pull that image, place, and replace it using code. Then I need to set the code up to prompt the user so that you can acutally design your monster.
