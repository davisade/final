# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

1. Using photoshop to generate many separate drawings of eyes, hair, weapon, clothes, etc... to allow the user to design a character.
    For example:
    Promt user to pick an eye type:
    Options(slanted, wide, closed, winking)
    user selects eye type and it is displayed and prompts user if they like it and want to move on, or reselect another eye type
    Repeat for other options (hair, mouth, nose, gender, etc...)

2. Create a virtual duck that walks in a direction and bounces off the edge of the screen (almost like the DVD bouncing logo). Randomly the duck will do a little jumping animation.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Working alone

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Any preference as to which project seems more interesting and fits criteria? 
Any advice off the bat?

Thank you
